# Become a sponsor to Tekimax

**Tekimax** builds and maintains the Universal AI Adapter Layer, standardizing the fragmented landscape of LLM APIs into a single, type-safe interface.

Our open source software is written in TypeScript and designed for the Edge, enabling developers to build AI applications that run anywhere—from Vercel Edge Functions to Cloudflare Workers and Node.js.
