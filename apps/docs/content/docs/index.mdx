# Tekimax SDK

**Tekimax SDK** is a type-safe, universal adapter for AI models. It standardizes the interface across major providers, allowing you to switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and local Ollama models without rewriting your application logic.

## Key Features

- **Universal Interface**: One API for chat completions, streaming, and tool calling.
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript and Zod for full runtime validation.
- **Edge Ready**: Runs on Vercel Edge, Cloudflare Workers, and simplistic Node.js environments.
- **Modular**: Install only the adapters you need.

## Installation

```bash
npm install tekimax-ts
```

## Quick Start

Initialize the client with your preferred provider.

```typescript
import { Tekimax } from 'tekimax-ts';
import { OpenAIProvider } from 'tekimax-openai';

const client = new Tekimax({
  provider: new OpenAIProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  }),
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```
