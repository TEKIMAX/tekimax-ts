# Reasoning Models

The Tekimax SDK provides first-class support for **Reasoning Models** (also known as "Thinking" models), such as DeepSeek R1 and newer OpenAI o-series models.

These models expose their internal "chain of thought" process, allowing you to display the reasoning steps to the user before the final answer is generated.

## Enabling Thinking

To enable reasoning, simply pass `think: true` in your chat options.

```typescript
const response = await client.text.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'deepseek-r1',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Solve this logic puzzle...' }],
  think: true // Enable reasoning capture
});
```

## Accessing Reasoning Data

The reasoning content is available in the `thinking` field of the message.

```typescript
const thinking = response.choices[0].message.thinking;
const content = response.choices[0].message.content;

console.log('--- Reasoning ---');
console.log(thinking);
console.log('--- Answer ---');
console.log(content);
```

### Streaming Support

Thinking is also supported in streaming mode. The `thinking` delta will be emitted as the model "thinks".

```typescript
const stream = await client.text.chat.completions.createStream({
  model: 'deepseek-r1',
  think: true,
  // ...
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  if (chunk.thinking) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.thinking); // Stream reasoning
  }
  if (chunk.delta) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.delta); // Stream answer
  }
}
```

## Provider Support

| Provider | Native Support | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ollama** | ✅ Yes | Uses native `thinking` field from Ollama API. |
| **OpenAI** | 🚧 Partial | Models like `o1` encapsulate reasoning; extraction depends on model version. |
| **Generic** | 🔄 Emulated | For models that output `<think>` tags (like DeepSeek via non-native API), the SDK creates a unified `thinking` field. |

## Utility: Parsing Raw Thinking

If you are using a provider that outputs raw `<think>` tags in the content instead of a structured field, the SDK provides a utility to parse it.

```typescript
import { parseThinking } from 'tekimax-ts';

const rawContent = "<think>Calculating...</think> The answer is 42.";
const { think, rest } = parseThinking(rawContent);

console.log(think); // "Calculating..."
console.log(rest);  // " The answer is 42."
```
