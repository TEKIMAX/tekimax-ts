# Security & Compliance

Tekimax SDK is designed with a "Secure by Default" philosophy, leveraging modern supply chain security practices to ensure integrity from build to runtime.

## Supply Chain Hardening

### Chainguard Images
Our runtime and build artifacts are based on [Chainguard Images](https://www.chainguard.dev/), which are:
- **Minimal**: Stripped of operating system shell, package managers, and other unnecessary binaries.
- **Hardened**: Designed to reduce the attack surface significantly.
- **Zero CVEs**: Rebuilt daily to patch upstream vulnerabilities immediately.

### Artifact Signing (Cosign)
All build artifacts are signed using **Cosign** (part of the Sigstore project). This allows you to verify that the SDK code you are running is exactly what was built by our CI/CD pipeline, with no tampering.

## Vulnerability Management

### Continuous Scanning (Trivy)
We employ **Trivy** in our CI/CD pipelines to continuously scan our dependencies and build artifacts for vulnerabilities.
- **Frequency**: Every commit and nightly schedule.
- **Policy**: Builds fail immediately if `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` vulnerabilities are detected.
- **Scope**: Scans cover both OS-level packages and Node.js/npm dependencies.

## Runtime Protection

### Type Safety & Validation (Zod)
Unlike standard SDKs, Tekimax enforces strict runtime validation using **Zod** schemas.
- **Spec-Driven**: All schemas are **generated directly from the OpenAPI specification**, ensuring 100% compliance with the API contract.
- **Input Validation**: Malformed requests are rejected before they leave your application.
- **Output Sanitization**: Unexpected responses from upstream providers are caught and handled gracefully.

### Strict TypeScript Configuration
The SDK is built with the strictest TypeScript settings enabled to prevent common classes of bugs:
- `strict: true`: Enables strict null checks and no implicit keys.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`: Forces developers to handle cases where array/object access might return `undefined`, preventing runtime crashes.

### Minimal Dependency Footprint
We aggressively minimize third-party dependencies to reduce the potential attack surface.
- **Core Dependencies**: Only `zod` (validation) and `eventsource-parser` (streaming) are used in the core runtime.
- **Zero bloat**: No heavy frameworks or unused utility libraries.

### Configuration Best Practices
Never hardcode API keys. The SDK is designed to read secrets from the environment automatically.

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Automatic Environment Loading
const client = new Tekimax({
  provider: new AnthropicProvider({
     // Reads process.env.ANTHROPIC_KEY automatically
  })
});

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoding Secrets
const client = new Tekimax({
  provider: new AnthropicProvider({
    apiKey: "sk-..." // Do not do this
  })
});
```
